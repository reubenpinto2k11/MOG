The house was built between 1855/56 by William Glover Joy, seed crusher and oil merchant, on land which earlier had belonged to the Earl of Cardigan's estate. Joy had entered his father's business ten years earlier to join a business which was the result of research work pioneered by his grandfather into the production of oil from seeds. The growth of the business was related most strongly to the development of the locomotive age and the local railway network. In 1868 Joy became Mayor of Leeds.
